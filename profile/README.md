# Welcome to Nebula Bear 🌌🐻

**Nebula Bear** is an organization focused on developing secure, high-concurrency software solutions for the Python ecosystem. Our mission is to simplify complex concurrency and threading issues, allowing developers to concentrate on business logic, without needing to delve into low-level algorithmic concerns.

## 🌟 Key Principles at Nebula Bear

- ⚡ **Concurrency and Safety**: We develop software that is secure and optimized for high concurrency environments, focusing on internal handling of locking and concurrency to simplify usage.
- 🤝 **Collaborative Community**: We are building a collaborative community of developers and contributors who share a passion for secure and efficient software.
- 🐍 **Python Efficiency**: Our tools are specifically designed to enhance Python development, including a thread-safe DataFrame implementation that simplifies concurrent data access.
- 🛠️ **Simplicity in Design**: We believe that when libraries are safer and more efficient, developers can focus on building business logic without needing to deal with low-level algorithms.

## 💻 Technologies We Use

At Nebula Bear, we are committed to:
- **C++ and Cython**: Leveraging the power of C++ and Cython for performance, while avoiding any embedded C code to ensure clarity, safety, and **maintainability**. 
   - We do **not** use raw `new` or manual memory management. Instead, we use **smart pointers** (like `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`) to handle resource management, ensuring memory safety and automatic deallocation via RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
   - This approach not only improves the code's clarity and safety but also enhances **maintainability**, making it easier to extend and debug the code over time.

## 🌍 GitHub-Only Access
